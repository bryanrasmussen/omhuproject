## Requirements

Requirements for viewing in browser - I have not taken the time to put in polyfills etc. 
So this requires a browser that supports 

fetch

furthermore to see it running you need to have port 9001 available as it will use 9001. 

## To Run

to run do 

  npm install

and then 

  npm run start

and then go to localhost:9001
